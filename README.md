# AI-Model-Robustness-Explorer

A web UI where users can:

Upload model predictions (CSV / JSON) and ground-truth labels (CSV / JSON)

Optionally upload sample inputs (images) or supply a dataset name

Choose contextual transformations (noise, brightness, blur, domain shift, adversarial)

Run robustness experiments (apply transforms, evaluate the model or evaluation metrics)

Visualize metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy heatmap, calibration curves, robustness curves, per-class breakdown, sample browser
